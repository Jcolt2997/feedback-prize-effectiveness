This repository is for the feedback-prize-effectiveness [Kagglecompetition] (<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-effectiveness/overview>).

## AK setup guide

1.

- Install `poetry` from [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/installation/)
- Poetry is a Python package manager that allows you to manage your dependencies in a project. I use it extensively in my projects as it makes dependency management easy.

2. 

- Run `poetry install` in the root of the project.
- This will install all the dependencies you need to run the project.
